# edf-anomyize

This program anonymizes an file in the European Data Format, you can read the specifications on the [web here](https://www.edfplus.info/specs/index.html).

The initial release will anonymize only the Local Patient Information (e.g. name, date of birth).  Future updates will anonymize additional fields.

I also wrote a short hexdump to display the header data (for a before/after comparison).
